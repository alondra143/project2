# <h1 align="center">CRYSTAL CULTIQUE</h1>
## Background Info
Learning about crystals has been prevalent in pop-culture for the last couple of years, but most websites that offer information are set up as jewelry shops or personal blogs. This app was designed with the idea to allow users to collaborate on what they want others to know about crystals they're familiar with, read and learn on other crystals they haven't researched on, and allow them to categorize and store crystals into different 'collections' for future reference. Sort of like a Pinterest for crystals.

## Next Steps (Icebox):
There's a lot of different ways that this app could grow and be more interactive between users. A main enhacement I would want to implement would be the ability to have users leave a comment on specific crystal pages to share their input on crystals that have already been created on the page. Being able to record the amount of users that have added a specific crystal to a collection can allow for users to see what's been popular on the site, and maybe would compell them to look into the crystal.

Other enhancements would be the ability to move crystals from one collection to another, rather than having to add it to different collections and delete it from the incorrect collection.

For back-end development, I would want to implement stricter guidelines for submitting a crystal into the database, allow users to sort the crystals by alphabetical order or most popular, create the ability to have users share their collections either with other users or on different platforms, and have a more perosnalized user profile from the data retrieved by oAuth Google.
